In this repo, we have created a demo project of User Post Management using MEAN Stack(Mongodb, Express, Angular2, Nodejs). Its a basic web app only performing CRUD operations.
We have created this application using angular-cli , introduced in Angular2.  

How to run this application.
1. Install nodejs on your system.
use **npm install** in command prompt in the location of you local folder where this project will be mapped, to install all the node    modules required for the application.
2. use node package manager i.e. npm to install angular-cli. Command is  
    **npm install -g angular-cli** 
3. Go to the application folder, run command prompt in that location. You can view the source code using Visual Studio or Visual Studio      Code. I have used VS Code for building this app. 
4. Type **code .** in command prompt in the location of your application. It will open the source in VS Code.
5. You can run command to run the application in VS Code integrated terminal.
6. Command to run the application is

9. In the location of your folder, run **node ./src/server,js** to start the express server. Port used for this server is **3000**. 
10. Also please remember to install and start the mongodb server as well before running this app. We have used **admin** database and **UserPosts** is the collection name.
